            I made this thingy back in 2008 over a course of 3 months.
            I wanted to create a game with very smooth animations and
            transitions all over the place.
            Before long I realized that on some platforms it's problematic
            even in principle to achieve consistent graphics performance.
            Moreover, the tools I chose made it difficult to port the game
            to more suitable platforms.
            In the end I decided to get the game to some stable point and
            stop there.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            I'm sharing all this in hope it might inspire some bright mind to
            create something beautiful.
            Or perhaps someone may even wish to finish this project and
            make a real game out of it.

          <h2>Features</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Freeplay mode only: single infinite level with all gameplay
            elements. There's no end of the game or gradual levels
            progression.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            It runs on Arch Linux, but with a reasonable amount of
            <a href="https://github.com/toothris/toothris">effort</a>
            can be built on Windows or Mac OS X.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            It's written in Stackless Python. All game objects are
            separate microthreads communicating with each other.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Game logic is deterministic. If you start with the same random
            seed and playback the same player inputs, you'll get the same
            results.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            It can record and playback demos. Comes in handy when debugging
            stuff or shooting gameplay videos.</p>

          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">
            The gameplay consists of two main parts: classical and extended.
            Classical part comes from the original Tetris game: there are 7
            different figures; each round a random figure is falling into the
            cup; whenever a row is completely filled up with figures, it's
            being removed from the cup.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Extended gameplay part is unique to this game.
            It's based on two concepts: actions and bonuses.
            <strong>Action</strong> is something the player does
            (for example, rotate the figure full circle, or slam it against
            the cup).
            <strong>Bonus</strong> is something the player gets
            (for example, the ability to slam the figure all the way to the
            very bottom destroying every other figure in its way).</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            After a player has performed a given action with all 7 figures,
            he/she gets the corresponding bonus.
            There's a table in the right part of the game screen showing
            which actions with which figures were made.
            When the row in this table is complete, player gets the bonus
            to the left of this row.</p>
          <p>The game is controlled with <strong>arrow keys</strong>.
             The menu is navigated with <strong>mouse</strong>. There are
             7 actions and 7 bonuses. They are described below.</p></div>
