          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">
            I thought it'd be cool to project random images from web search
            on the wall in my apartment.
            Sort of a live poster, which changes the picture every once
            in a while.
            Hardware parts wasn't a problem - 320x240 projector for $50 and
            Raspberry Pi for $35 did great job for a price.
            Though I couldn't find an open-source tool to fetch random pictures
            from the web, so I wrote one.
            Hope you'll have as much fun with it as I do!</p>

          <h2>Features</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">It runs continuously as a daemon, gets URLs
            from web image search, downloads images, resizes, and sets random
            image from current search query as X desktop background every now
            and then.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Can be controlled through file system via
            <span class="label label-default">echo</span> and
            <span class="label label-default">touch</span>.
            I use SSH client on my smartphone as remote control.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Available
            <a href="https://github.com/webgetpics/webgetpics#Commands"
            >commands</a> include: change search query, skip image, blacklist
            controls.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Global and per-query blacklists.
             You can block image from appearing in current query
             or all queries.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Offline cache. All images are stored on
            disk. If network goes offline, slide show continues with what
            was already downloaded.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Adjustable download speed limit.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Duplicate images are skipped in slide show.
            Duplicate detection is based on pixel data, so identical images
            get detected even if they were downloaded from different websites,
            have different names and different metadata.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Built with 30% more love than closest
            competitor!</p><br><br></div>
